In addition to my work and masters, I enjoy working on small projects, reading books, writing short stories and occasionally playing on my PlayStation. Photography is another passion of mine, and I love capturing moments, especially during my vacations. Feel free to explore my work!\n","date":"23 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Creative Work! # I enjoy writing technical blogs, particularly when I gain a deep understanding of a topic that I find exciting and worth sharing with others. My writing primarily focuses on subjects such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Core Python, and, more recently, Large Language Models (LLMs).\nArticles # First Semester experience at the OMSCS program!\nThis article talks about my first semester experience in the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech.\nMedium Articles # I have already published a few articles on medium and you can find links to those articles here as well.\nPython Toolkit v.1\nThis article explores a few critical concepts of python programming language like Decorators, Context Managers, Dunder Methods and Getter, Setter methods.\nFine Tuning Gemma-2b-it on Anime Dataset\nLLMs have been becoming mainstream these days. In this article I tried to fine tune a small 2B Gemma model on anime dataset using lora, qlora concepts.\nEnd To End ML Pipeline Using Docker\nBuilding models have always been a primary focus of Data Scientists. But it is equally important to understand what it takes to deploy a ML model in production to be used by end users. This article explores how to dockerize a machine learning pipeline using docker.\n","date":"23 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Articles","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" Love for Photography! # I am very passionate about photography and try to click pictures whenever I find a good shot.

I try to work on different kinds of projects, like a LLM Quizzer game to a RAG based book companion app to an encryption system that is based on huffman encoding and enigma machine and finally a custom version of TFIDF model that handles class imbalance while picking features. Below are a few projects that I have worked on(both as a team and individually)\nWeighted Class TFIDF\nThe scikit-learn implementation of TFIDF picks features on the basis of frequency. This approach works fine if the dataset has classes having balanced counts but can be problematic if the classes are imbalanced. Weighted Class TFIDF tackles this problem by using the same scikit learn TFIDF in a class wise manner to first select features and then use them in downstream tasks.\nBook Companion App\nThis project was my first attempt at exploring RAG systems. I specifically wanted to build a RAG system that can enable people to query books. I also showcased this project as part of a lightning talk at one of the seminars that I took in my masters.\nDeep Encrypt\nAs part of our minor project during my bachelors, we worked on a encryption system that combines huffman encoding with the workings of the enigma machine.\nFuture Works # Recently, I have developed a fascination for creating games using Python. I aim to immerse myself in the entire end-to-end process, from designing sprites and crafting levels to enhancing gameplay mechanics for an enjoyable experience. However, before diving into large and complex projects, I plan to start by building a few simple games. One idea I am currently exploring is the development of text-based adventure games powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":" A new hobby! # Its been a year since I have started writing short stories and have once participated in a short story writing contest.
